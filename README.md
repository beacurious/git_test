# git_test

This repo was created by Belinda Fabian as an example in the 'Git it' workshop presented by the MQ R Users Group on 22 October 2020. 

In the workshop we demonstrated a version control workflow for R/RStudio including how to:
- create a GitHub repository
- clone it to your local computer using an RStudio project 
- create a directory & script file
- make changes and do commits
- push the changes to GitHub

A recording of the workshop is available in the workshop repository at https://github.com/mqRusers/2020-10-22-Git-GitHub
